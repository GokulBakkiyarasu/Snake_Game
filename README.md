# Snake Game using Turtle Graphics and OOP's Concepts:

*This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Turtle Graphics and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

*The game consists of a player-controlled snake that moves around a game board, eating food and growing longer with each meal. The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body.

*The code for this game is written using Python's built-in Turtle Graphics module, which provides a simple way to create graphics and animations. The game logic is implemented using OOP concepts, with separate classes for the game board, snake, and food.

*To play the game, simply run the Python script and use the arrow keys to control the snake's movements. The game board will be displayed on a new window and the score will be updated as the snake eats more food.

*Overall, this Snake Game project is a great way to learn about Python's Turtle Graphics module and OOP concepts, as well as to have some fun with a classic game.
