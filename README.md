# Snake Game using Turtle Graphics and OOP's Concepts:

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Turtle Graphics and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

The game consists of a player-controlled snake that moves around a game board, eating food and growing longer with each meal. The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body.

The code for this game is written using Python's built-in Turtle Graphics module, which provides a simple way to create graphics and animations. The game logic is implemented using OOP concepts, with separate classes for the game board, snake, and food.

To play the game, simply run the Python script and use the arrow keys to control the snake's movements. The game board will be displayed on a new window and the score will be updated as the snake eats more food.

Overall, this Snake Game project is a great way to learn about Python's Turtle Graphics module and OOP concepts, as well as to have some fun with a classic game.
